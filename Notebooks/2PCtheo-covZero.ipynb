    "In the next step it is discussed how the $\\phi_m$ are chosen in order to ensure uncorrelated $Z_m$'s and such that $\\text{Var}(Z_m) \\geq \\text{Var}(Z_{m+1}) \\forall m \\in I_{-p}$. The first coordinates $\\phi_1$ must be chosen in order to maximize the variance of the random variable $Z_1$. Recall from the previous argument *(1.5)* that the distribution of $Z_m$ is a function of the coordinates $\\phi_m$ with expected value zero. Since the variance of $Z_m$ can be arbitrarily high, see formula *(1.5)*, one does restrict the choice of $\\phi_m$ to vectors of length one.\n",

    "This problem can be solved using the lagrangian with the constraint $w' w = 1$ \n",

    "From equation *(1.7)* it follows that $\\left(\\pmb C_X \\right) w = \\lambda w$. Hence, the solution vector w is an eigenvector of $\\pmb C_X$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda$. Since $\\pmb C_X$ is a $p \\times p$ matrix, it has $p$ eigenvalues $\\lambda_1 \\geq \\lambda_2 \\geq \\dots \\geq \\lambda_p > 0$ with p corresponding unit-length eigenvectors $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_p$. All $\\lambda_i$ are greather than zero, since $\\pmb C_X$ is positive definite. Thus, the question arises which eigenvalue to use to maximize the variance. Since we can express any eigenvector as a function of the corresponding eigenvalue, it is sufficient to maximize over the eigenvalue.\n",

    "Hence, the maximum variance is captured by choosing the largest eigenvalue, which is by definition, $\\lambda_1$. The corresponding eigenvector $v_1$ is then chosen to be $\\phi_1$. Thus, it is enough to compute the largest eigenvalue of the VCV matrix of all the $X_i$ to compute $\\phi_1$ and with that $z_1$. Armed with $\\phi_1$, it is possible to compute $\\phi_2, \\phi_3, \\dots, \\phi_M$ iteratively by defining new random variables \n",

    "and solving the former problem for $\\text{Var}(Z_m)$ using the random variables $\\begin{pmatrix} X_1^{(m)} & X_2^{(m)} & \\dots & X_p^{(m)} \\end{pmatrix}'$ to get $\\phi_m$. It turns out that $\\pmb \\phi$ equals the matrix $\\pmb V = \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 & v_2 & \\dots & v_M \\end{pmatrix} $, whereby $v_i$ is the eigenvector with length one of $\\pmb C_X$ to the corresponding $i$-th highest eigenvalue $\\lambda_i$. Hence, we can compute $\\pmb \\phi$ by only computing the eigenvectors of $\\pmb C_X$ and sort them in decending order by the corresponding eigenvalues. Note that therefore $\\pmb \\phi$ is an orthonormal matrix. Subsequent, $\\pmb Z$ is obtained by matrix multiplication of $\\pmb X$ and $\\pmb \\phi$ as in formula *(1.2)*. In theory, there is thus a non-stochastic true $\\pmb Z$ matrix of principal components."
