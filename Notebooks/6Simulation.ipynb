    "Since the eigenvectors are 8-Dimensional, they cannot be illustrated in a graph. Hence, I decided to start with a 2-dimensional case to give a first intuition how $\\hat{\\pmb \\phi}$ converges to $\\pmb \\phi$ if he sample size increases. For this purpose I decided to use the variables *years of schooling* and *years of parent's education*. I chose these two variables since they have a high correlation of 0.9085 and had the same scale in the unstandardized set-up.   "
