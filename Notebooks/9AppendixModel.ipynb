    "\n",
    "Let $Y = F_X(x)$ be the  cdf of a random variable $X$ with density $f_X(x)$. Since $F_X(x)$ is continous and strictly increasing, it follows that $F_X(x)$ is surjective and injective and hence invertible. The inverse function is denoted by $F^{-1}_x(x)$. $F_Y(y)$, the cdf of the cdf, is defined as $P(Y \\leq y)$. Hence $F_Y(y) = P(Y \\leq y) = P(F_X(x) \\leq y)$. Since $F_X(x) \\in [0,1]$, it follows that $P(F_X(x) \\leq 1) = 1$ and $P(F_X(X) < 0) = 0$. Thus, the case of interest is when $y \\in [0,1]$. Using the inverse, one gets $P(F_X(X) \\leq y) = P(X \\leq F^{-1}_x(y)) = F_X(F^{-1}_x(y)) = y$. Thus, the cdf of $Y$ is given by\n",
