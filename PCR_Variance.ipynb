    "be the matrix of indepedent variables and $\\varepsilon \\in \\mathbb{M}_{1 \\times n}$ a random vector.\n",
    "The data generating process is $Y = \\pmb X \\beta + \\varepsilon$. For ease of notation, we assume the expected value of any covariate and of the dependent variable to be $0$. Hence, $\\text{E} ( \\pmb X ) = \\pmb0$ i.e. $\\text{E}(X_i) = 0$ for $\\forall i$. Since we can demean any linear model, this is not restrictive in any sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "We build $M$ new variables $Z_1, Z_2, \\dots, Z_M$ as orthogonal linear combinations of $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_p$. Note that $M \\leq p$ otherwise the $Z_m$'s cannot be orthogonal to each other. Denoting the scalars that are used to build $Z_m$ by $\\phi_m$ we can write \n",

    "$$\\pmb Z = \\begin{pmatrix} Z_1 & Z_2 & \\dots & Z_M \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\pmb X \\cdot \\phi_1 & \\pmb X \\cdot \\phi_2 & \\dots & \\pmb X \\cdot \\phi_M \\end{pmatrix} = \\pmb X \\phi.$$ \n",
    "We follow many textbooks and take $\\pmb \\phi$ as deterministic. However, in practice it is actually a matrix to estimate and therefore adds additional randomness increasing the variance of the estimated $\\pmb Z$ matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all $n$ random variables in $Z_{m}$ come from the same distribution and the expected value of the vector $Z_m$ can be computed as\n",

    "Hence, we can express the variance of the components in $Z_m$ as $\\text{E}(Z'_m Z_m) - \\text{E}(Z'_m) \\text{E}(Z_m) = \\text{E}(Z'_m Z_m)$. We can estimate this variance using the sample as $\\frac{1}{n-1} Z'_m Z_m$.\n",

    "In the next step we (recursively) compute the values in $\\pmb \\phi$. For this purpose we start by computing the vector $\\phi_1$. Since the goal is to build uncorrelated variables that carry the maximum variance from $\\pmb X$, we construct $\\phi_1$ such that $Z_1$ has the maxmimum possible variance for any $\\phi_1$ with $||\\phi_1|| = 1$ (can be derived by properties of the *Rayleigh Quotient*). Hence, we need to solve the following problem\n",

    "$$\n",
    "It can be shown that the solution to the Rayleigh Quotient problem is the eigenvector that corresponds to the largest eigenvalue of $X'X$, which is equivalently to the eigenvector that corresponds to the largest eigenvalue of $\\frac{1}{n-1}X'X$. Since the $X_i$'s are demeaned, the latter equals the estimated covariance matrix of the $X_i$ variables. Armed with $\\phi_1$, we can now compute $\\phi_2, \\phi_3, \\dots, \\phi_M$ iteratively by setting $\\pmb X_m = \\pmb X - \\sum_{j = 1}^{m-1} X \\phi'_j \\phi_j$ and solving the former problem for $\\pmb X_m$ to get $\\phi_m$. \n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that $\\pmb \\phi$ equals the matrix $\\pmb V = \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 & v_2 & \\dots & v_M \\end{pmatrix} $, where $v_i$ is the eigenvector from $X'X$ to the corresponding $i$-th highest eigenvalue $\\lambda_i$. Hence, we can compute $\\pmb \\phi$ by only computing the eigenvectors of $X'X$ and sort them in decending order by the corresponding eigenvalues. Subsequent, $\\pmb Z$ is obtained by matrix multiplication of $\\pmb X$ and $\\pmb \\phi$."
