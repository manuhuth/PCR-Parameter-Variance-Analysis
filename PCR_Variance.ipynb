Since the variance could be arbitrarily high othwerise, one does only consider $\\phi_1$ with $||\\phi_1|| = 1$ (can be derived by properties of the *Rayleigh Quotient*).

From equation *(1.4)* it follows that $\\frac{1}{n-1} \\pmb X' \\pmb X$ and $\\pmb X' \\pmb X$ have the same eigenvectors but different scaled eigenvalues. Hence, the transformation to get the Rayleigh-Quotient does not change the order of the eigenvalues, and tehrefore of the $z_m$'s, and the eigenvectors. Armed with $\\phi_1$, we can now compute $\\phi_2, \\phi_3, \\dots, \\phi_M$ iteratively by setting $\\pmb X_m = \\pmb X - \\sum_{j = 1}^{m-1} X \\phi'_j \\phi_j$ and solving the former problem for $\\pmb X_m$ to get $\\phi_m$. \n",

Hence, we can compute $\\pmb \\phi$ by only computing the eigenvectors of $X'X$ and sort them in decending order by the corresponding eigenvalues. Subsequent, $\\pmb Z$ is obtained by matrix multiplication of $\\pmb X$ and $\\pmb \\phi$ as in formula *(1.5)*.\n",
